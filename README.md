# CV_Offsides_Model
This is a final project for EE379K, Computer Vision class. We are building a computer vision model in python that can detect when someone is offsides in soccer from a still of the game.

Please add the Dataset to the root folder.
Dataset should be structured like this.
    
Dataset/Offside_Images

To run, please move into the virtual environment.

On MacOS:
source ./venv/Scripts/activate

On Windows/Linux
./venv/Scripts/activate

If it is your first time entering the virtual environment, you will need to install the required pip packages. To install all the packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

To freeze your current packages, use:

pip freeze -l > requirements.txt
