# CV_Offsides_Model
This is a final project for EE379K, Computer Vision class. We are building a computer vision model in python that can detect when someone is offsides in soccer from a still of the game.

Please add the Dataset to the root folder.
Dataset should be structured like this.
    
Dataset/Offside_Images

To run this -> Please download the required packages using pip

cv2
numpy

Eventually we will get a CONDA environment working.
